# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN with various Normalization techniques

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN is trained using various normalization techniques such as Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, and Group Normalization. Our goal is to compare the performance of the CNN with different normalization techniques and to understand the impact of normalization on the training and performance, including the number of misclassified images.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

Here are some sample images from the CIFAR-10 dataset:
